# How the Internet Works

The internet connects millions of devices globally, enabling communication and information sharing. But how does it actually work?

## Key Concepts

- **IP Address**: A unique identifier for each device.
- **DNS**: Converts website names (like google.com) to IP addresses.
- **Packets**: Data is split into packets and sent via routers.

## Journey of a Web Request

1. You type a URL in your browser.
2. The browser asks DNS for the IP address.
3. It sends a request to that server.
4. The server responds with HTML, CSS, and JS.
5. The browser renders the page.

Simple, yet powerful!
